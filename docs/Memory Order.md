# compare_exchange #compare_exchange
There are two types of `compare_exchange` methods 
```cpp
bool compare_exchange_weak( T& expected, T desired, std::memory_order success, std::memory_order failure ) noexcept;

bool compare_exchange_strong( T& expected, T desired, std::memory_order success, std::memory_order failure ) noexcept;
```

Both methods are used to change the value of an atomic variable if its current value equals the `expected` argument.

The difference between the strong and weak versions is that the weak version may fail spuriously (i.e., it may fail even if the current value equals the expected value), whereas the strong version will only fail if the current value does not equal the expected value.

The weak version may fail spuriously because some operating systems do not directly support the `compare_exchange` operation. Instead, they use LL/SC (Load-Link/Store-Conditional) instructions, which are two separate operations. If any exceptional events, such as a [context switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch), another load-link, or even another load or store operation, occur between these two instructions, the store-conditional can fail. Older implementations may fail if there are any updates broadcast over the memory bus.

`compare_exchange_strong` is more expensive because it may be implemented with a loop using LL/SC instructions on such operating systems. This is why `compare_exchange_weak` is often preferred.

# Fetch Operations #fetch
There are several types of `fetch` operations available. These operations, like `compare_exchange`, may not be supported by all operating systems (e.g., some OSes might not support the `OR` operation atomically).![[Pasted image 20240719215845.png]] `Fetch` operations are generally more efficient than `compare_exchange` because they provide a direct instruction for the CPU to modify the value of an atomic variable. This means the operation cannot fail, as the CPU simply fetches the value and applies the change without needing to check the current value. 

For atomic operations not supported by the OS, such as `OR`, they might be implemented using `compare_exchange`.
# memory_order_relaxed
![[Pasted image 20240710004003.png]]
With `memory_order_relaxed`, no memory fences are applied, allowing the compiler and CPU to reorder read/write instructions in any way that they believe will improve performance.
Of course, both CPU and compiler still need to follow the read and write order of one variable. 

`Example`: We have an atomic variable `x` and three non-atomic variables `a b c`.
```cpp
a = 1;
b += 2;
x.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
c += 2;
```
Due to we are using relaxed memory ordered, so it's possible to CPU and compiler reorder ``all`` instructions to any way they want.
# memory_order_acquire
![[Pasted image 20240711225034.png]]
`Acquire` barrier guarantees that  all memory operations scheduled after the barrier in the program order become visible after the barrier.
- `All operations` is all `reads` and `writes`.
- `All opeartions` is all operations in all variable (not just on the atomic variable).
Reads and writes can't be reordered from after to before the barrier.
- Only for the thread that issued the barrier, which meant other thread still can applied different memory order.

`Example`: All operations after the `x.load(std::memory_order_acquire) which colered by yellow` can't move to before it. But it possible to have some operations before the `x.load` move to after it.
```cpp
std::atomic<int> index{0};
vector<int> a(2, 0);

void producer() {
	index.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

void consumer() {
	index.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
	a[index] = 3;
}

int main() {
	std::thread t1(producer);
	std::thread t2(consumer);
	t1.join();
	t2.join();
	return 0;
}
```
It's possible to get the `a[0] == 3` and `index == 1`. Because there isn't barrier applied to make sure that the `index.load` need to happen before the `a[index] = 3`.

```cpp
std::atomic<int> index{0};
vector<int> a(2, 0);

void producer() {
	index.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

void consumer() {
	index.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
	a[index] = 3;
}

int main() {
	std::thread t1(producer);
	std::thread t2(consumer);
	t1.join();
	t2.join();
	return 0;
}
```
By applied `std::memory_order_acquire`, we can make sure that if the value of `index == 1` the array `a == {0, 3}`.

# memory_order_release
![[Pasted image 20240711231913.png]]
`Release` barrier guarantees that all memory operations scheduled before the barrier in the program order become visible before the barrier.
Reads and writes can't be reordered from before to after the barrier.
![[Pasted image 20240711231929.png]]
`Example`: All operations after the `x.store(std::memory_order_acquire) which colered by yellow` can't move to after it. But it possible to have some operations after the `x.load` move to before it.
```cpp
std::atomic<int> index{0};
vector<int> a(2, 0);

void producer() {
	a[index] = 3;
	index.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

void consumer() {
	index.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
	std::cout << "a[" << index << "] = " << a[index];
}

int main() {
	std::thread t1(producer);
	std::thread t2(consumer);
	
	t1.join();
	t2.join();
	
	return 0;
}
```
It's possible for consumer to get `a[1] = 3`, due to we don't apply any barrier to prevent the order of operations in producer thread.
```cpp
std::atomic<int> index{0};
vector<int> a(2, 0);

void producer() {
	a[index] = 3;
	index.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_release);
}

void consumer() {
	index.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
	std::cout << "a[" << index << "] = " << a[index];
}

int main() {
	std::thread t1(producer);
	std::thread t2(consumer);
	
	t1.join();
	t2.join();
	
	return 0;
}
```
By apply the `std::memory_order_release`, we can make sure that the array `a will always = {3, 0}` instead of `{0, 3}`.

# memory_order_acq_rel
A read-modify-write operation with this memory order is both an _acquire operation_ and a _release operation_. No memory reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before the load, nor after the store. All writes in other threads that release the nyxe atomic variable are visible before the modification and the modification is visible in other threads that acquire the nyxe atomic variable.
# memory_order_seq_cst
A load operation with this memory order performs an _acquire operation_, a store performs a _release operation_, and read-modify-write performs both an _acquire operation_ and a _release operation_, **plus a single total order exists in which all threads observe all modifications in the nyxe order.**
